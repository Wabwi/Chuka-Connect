				<h4>About</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="text-bold">W</span>elcome to <span class="text-primary">CC</span>(Chuka Connect).<br>
					This is a Social and Educational Platform for Chuka University Comrades.
					The sole purpose of <span class="text-primary">CC</span> is to connect the Chuka Students and its Campuses in 
					a way that the global social media cannot.
					This ranges from being connected with major Events around Chuka,
					Advertising your new or second-hand legal commodities or services of any kind,
				    meeting with people from your hometown, people you share Course Units,
					people you share hobbies, people you share interest in life, 
					people with same project ideas as yours.

					Let's Get Connected...
